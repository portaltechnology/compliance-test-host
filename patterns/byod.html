                        <p>This pattern provides guidance for blueprint users to allow access to Microsoft 365 services from various personally owned devices, without the need to enroll those devices. This is referred to as “bring your own device” (BYOD), within an enterprise mobility strategy.</p>

<p>BYOD allows users to perform their work in a flexible manner within specific use-cases allowing access to corporate systems from personally owned devices across multiple business personas. BYOD provides a range of benefits including more flexible working arrangements for employees creating greater business agility for the Agency, catering for use cases such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working remotely from within another government Agency premises,</li>
  <li>Travel or working from home,</li>
  <li>Ad-hoc access to calendar and mail,</li>
  <li>Microsoft Teams collaboration and chat, and</li>
  <li>Accessing multiple tenants from a single device.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pattern works through various use cases and configuration required on top of the Protected Utility blueprint, taking into account vendor best practice configuration advice on this area from <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/133/2021/03/MEA-Blueprint-for-BYOD-Use-v1.0-Final-Version.pdf">Microsoft’s BYOD blueprint</a>.</p>

<p>It is recommended to read the ACSC risk management publication for enterprise mobility. See <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/risk-management-enterprise-mobility-including-bring-your-own-device">Risk Management of Enterprise Mobility Including Bring Your Own Device</a>.</p>

<p>This pattern suggests <strong>two BYOD access options</strong> dependent on the risk appetite of the Agency and provides some known risk and ISM control guidance.</p>

<p>Agencies adopting BYOD should perform their own risk assessments and follow ACSC guidance in regards to the requirements surrounding the platform and adequate separation between private and corporate data.</p>

<p>It is not recommended to process or store sensitive or classified (OFFICIAL:Sensitive and above) data on non-corporately managed devices. For commonwealth entities, non-sensitive data is marked as OFFICIAL.</p>

<p>This pattern does not discuss Agency policy surrounding the use of personally/privately-owed devices. The following guidance from the ACSC for OFFICIAL and PROTECTED BYOD implementation is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legal advice is sought prior to allowing privately-owned mobile devices to access systems or data (<strong>ISM</strong> control 1297)</li>
  <li>Personnel accessing OFFICIAL and PROTECTED systems or data using a privately-owned mobile device use an ACSC approved platform, a security configuration in accordance with ACSC guidance and have enforced separation of work data from any personal data (<strong>ISM</strong> control 1400)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Protected Utility blueprint does not specify any particular BYOD solution, allowing Agencies to implement a solution that best meets their needs.</p>

<p>The technical controls that are described in this document have been grouped into two options that can be implemented together or separately, to provide various BYOD use cases:</p>

<p><strong>Mobile device access</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Allows access to some Microsoft 365 applications from personal mobile devices</li>
  <li>Granular control of user policies, session controls using Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps when protecting browser apps</li>
  <li>Intune Application Protection policies to enforce secure containerisation for company data</li>
  <li>Conditional Access enforced Agency approved apps for Mobile Devices</li>
  <li>Suits personas for ad-hoc access to Teams, SharePoint and Outlook on Android and iOS phone or tablet devices</li>
  <li>Agencies to risk assess for their environment and data classification</li>
  <li>This BYOD option is not recommended for use cases involving access to sensitive or classified information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Virtual desktop</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Azure virtual desktop requires an Azure subscription</li>
  <li>Uses Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) to provide a desktop experience that closely matches the corporate desktop, including legacy application access</li>
  <li>Supports any client device able to access AVD</li>
  <li>Lower security risk approach compared to mobile device, but offers greater use cases</li>
  <li>More complexity and cost involved to deploy and operate</li>
  <li>Suits personas for enterprise mobility, including cross-Agency working</li>
  <li>Agencies to risk assess for their environment and data classification.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/patterns/byodoptions.png" alt="BYOD options" /></p>

<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>

<p>The following represent the assumptions when considering to deploy either BYOD options into an existing blueprint deployment:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Protected Utility blueprint deployed in a cloud-only or hybrid pattern</li>
  <li>Licensing as per the DTA PROTECTED utility</li>
  <li>Azure Virtual Desktop requires a suitable Azure subscription</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The following represent the prerequisites before deploying the selection BYOD option.</p>

<p>All deployment types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Protected Utility blueprint AVD pattern to be deployed for the virtual desktop pattern, see <a href="https://desktop.gov.au/patterns/avd.html">Azure Virtual Desktop pattern</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud native:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No cloud-only specific prerequisites</li>
</ul>

<p>Hybrid:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No hybrid only specific prerequisites</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/patterns/flow.png" alt="BYO Flow Chart" /></p>

<h3 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Introducing BYOD carries some risk for the Agency. While some controls can be addressed through a technical control, others require user training and Agency policy (for example, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)) in place to ensure responsibilities are met and understood, and the appropriate mitigations are in place.</p>

<p>The following controls while not exhaustive should be a focus while assessing the risk for BYOD under an enterprise mobility strategy.</p>

<p>Note, refer to the <a href="https://desktop.gov.au/blueprint/security/system-security-plan.html">System Security Plan</a> for full traceability against all controls for the Protected Utility blueprint outside of this pattern.</p>

<h3 id="mobile-device-access-byod-option-1">Mobile device access (BYOD Option 1)</h3>

<p>The Mobile device access option will leverage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Conditional Access policies</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defender for Cloud Apps to prevent data leakage and spills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Intune - Application Protection Policies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The outcome will allow the end user to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access email using Outlook on their personal Mobile Device.</li>
  <li>Access Teams on their personal Mobile Device</li>
  <li>Access SharePoint Online on their personal Mobile Device</li>
  <li>Use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint approved mobile apps.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mobile devices</strong> in the context of this BYOD option are smart phones or tablets running Apple iOS or Android.</p>

<h4 id="mobile-application-management">Mobile Application Management</h4>

<p>Access via Mobile Application Management (MAM)) is provided through approved applications published by Microsoft to the respective app store (Apple AppStore or Google Play Store).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intune app protection policies provide a container policy to the applications to secure corporate data, and prevent download upload, copy and paste actions, and enforce a PIN/appropriate passcode.</li>
  <li>A MAM model does not require the device to be managed (MDM) or enrolled so will carry additional risk. Intune app protection MAM policies can be applied without enrolment requirement, this is referred to as MAM without enrolment (MAM-WE). Approved applications can be defined through the Conditional Access policies.  Conditional Access policies can be applied based on various attributes such as device state, user group or location.</li>
  <li>With MAM, iOS devices do not require Apple Business Manager or Apple Push Notification Service certificate configuration (the configuration in the blueprint for MDM can be ignored if this pattern is the only method for Mobile Devices for the Agency). Without MDM policies and enrolment, various functions cannot be prevented such as the ability to restrict screenshot for example.</li>
  <li>To protect the data in the event that a device is lost or stolen or if the employee leaves the Agency, Selective Wipe capability can be used to wipe the corporate data in managed apps from the device. Intune app protection policies can help prevent data contamination between non managed apps on a client device.</li>
  <li>Agencies should provide some guidance or user guides to their users on how to install the Office applications on their devices and authenticate to avoid confusion. Note, these actions and out-of-the-box setup are generally automated within a supervised, managed deployment.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="azure-ad-identity-protection">Azure AD Identity Protection</h4>

<p>Azure AD Identity Protection is an Azure AD feature that protects the identity through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>automation of detection and remediation of identity-based risks,</li>
  <li>includes additional challenge to user based on risk detection in real time, and</li>
  <li>Provides a portal for identify based investigation.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="defender-for-cloud-apps">Defender for Cloud Apps</h4>

<p>Defender for Cloud Apps (formerly Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS)) provides capabilities that can restrict access to only authorised platforms and device types and can minimise the risk of data loss and spills within a supported app or browser. Defender for Cloud App Session Control is enabled through Conditional Access policies (App Control), which enables Defender for Cloud App to act as a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)) for the connection from the browser to the data source. Further control through the CASB can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Block data upload/download</li>
  <li>Check device characteristics</li>
  <li>Block printing</li>
  <li>Block copy/paste actions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="virtual-desktop-byod-option-2">Virtual desktop (BYOD Option 2)</h3>

<p>The virtual desktop (Azure Virtual Desktop) device access option will leverage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Azure AD MFA and Conditional Access policies</li>
  <li>Secure Azure compute boundary that will provide the environment where data is accessed, creating full separation between the personal device and the corporate desktop.</li>
</ul>

<p>The outcome will allow the end user to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access all M365 applications, from within the virtual desktop only</li>
  <li>Access all other corporate applications, from within the virtual desktop only</li>
  <li>Prevent copy, paste, saving of files and printing on the Mobile Device.</li>
</ul>

<p>The recommendation to implement this option is to utilise the <a href="https://desktop.gov.au/patterns/avd.html">Azure Virtual Desktop blueprint</a> pattern. The solution requires architectural decisions to be made that are outside the scope of this pattern. This BYOD option is more difficult to implement than the MAM BYOD option 1, but offers a less complex implementation than other virtual desktop solutions.</p>

<p>The pattern recommends the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A suitably configured Azure subscription is available, which may include connectivity to the Agency’s IT premises (e.g. data centre) where connectivity to hybrid Active Directory or corporate apps is required.</li>
  <li>Windows Desktop OS multi-session operation system is used to offer greater supportability and cost savings than that of a single instance virtual machines.</li>
  <li>Conditional Access policies are configured to allow access to the AVD application without enrollment or restriction, and to allow access to Microsoft 365 applications inside the virtual desktop. This will allow personal devices to connect to the service without restriction but only the virtual desktop to access the data.</li>
  <li>Copy and paste actions, file copy and print are prevented within RDP client properties and group policy to prevent virtual channels being used to copy data in and out of the PROTECTED boundary (the virtual desktop).</li>
  <li>Multifactor authentication is enforced with session controls to prevent multiple day use of the MFA token.</li>
  <li>Identity Protection is configured to allow detection of risky sign-ins.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Mobile devices</strong> or <strong>personal devices</strong> in the context of this BYOD option are consumer desktop devices using MacOS or Windows, or devices provided by another government Agency (cross-Agency working use-cases).</p>

<h4 id="data-segregation">Data segregation</h4>

<p>AVD allows users access to Office 365 applications that are hosted on a Windows virtual desktop, including any hybrid applications provided these are configured appropriately within the Azure environment. The user interacts with the applications within the virtual desktop preventing the user from extracting corporate data to the local physical device.</p>

<p>Virtual desktops provide a greater level of security accessing Agency data over a MAM solution (option 1) as all the data remains within the Azure secure boundary (the Azure enterprise landing zone).</p>

<h4 id="client-device-access">Client device access</h4>

<p>The mobile device used to access the virtual desktop is not limited to a particular platform, but a Windows client device is recommended. Users can choose from using a HTML5 web browser (e.g. Edge or Chrome), or the official Azure Virtual Desktop client, to access the virtual desktop.</p>

<h4 id="implementation-decisions-1">Implementation Decisions</h4>

<p>The following tables describe the high level implementation decisions</p>
