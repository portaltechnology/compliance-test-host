<h3 id="system-name">System name</h3>

<p>CloudSystem.</p>

<h3 id="system-overview">System overview</h3>

<p>The CloudSystem leverages the Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) assessed Microsoft Azure and Office 365 platforms and their associated services. The CloudSystem includes the following components to improve the security posture of a target Agency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cloud identity – Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) configuration including Conditional Access policies allowing log in from anywhere and appropriate security policies to be applied.</li>
  <li>Office 365 – Configuration of Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Forms, Microsoft Whiteboard, and Microsoft Planner allowing cloud-based file storage and collaboration.</li>
  <li>Device management – Management of security and configuration profiles for enrolled devices including the testing against security baselines and confirmation of security compliance.</li>
  <li>Applications – Delivery and configuration of applications appropriate to the user.</li>
  <li>Security stack – Security configuration of Office 365 and endpoint devices to maximise compliance and minimise risk.</li>
  <li>Autopilot deployment – Configuration of Autopilot to allow for automated deployment (and redeployment when required) of devices with no user interaction.</li>
  <li>Support – A flexible support model where system administration and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is provided regardless of whether the support is carried out by in house staff, third party contractors or a managed service provider.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="system-classification">System classification</h3>

<p>The CloudSystem is designed to be able to achieve and maintain security accreditation up to PROTECTED.</p>

<h3 id="system-purpose-and-scope">System purpose and scope</h3>

<p>The CloudSystem is intended to achieve a PROTECTED standard and raise Australian Government Agencies’ cyber security posture. The CloudSystem details technology and configuration settings to deploy a cloud-only Microsoft 365 solution.</p>

<p>Note: The Microsoft 365 suite includes multiple products including Windows 10, Office 365 and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EM+S).</p>

<h3 id="system-boundary">System boundary</h3>

<p>The system boundary is the subscription level of the Microsoft 365 implementation. The Azure AD tenant and all Microsoft 365 components (including both Azure and Office 365 hosted services), the transport of data between the endpoint devices and cloud services, along with the endpoint devices themselves, are included within the system. Network components are not considered to be part of the system.</p>

<p>As shown in the following figure, the system boundary includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft 365 (including Azure and Office 365)</li>
  <li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</li>
  <li>Subscription and its management</li>
  <li>Azure AD tenant and its management</li>
  <li>Endpoints including the hardware, firmware, and the management of the endpoints</li>
  <li>Transport of data between the endpoints and the cloud components</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This means that Transport Layer Security (TLS) would be included within the system boundary, but the network devices and mail gateway would not be included in the system boundary from a security perspective. Those items outside of the system boundary will be consumed and the existing security documentation will be utilised.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/security/security-boundary.png" alt="Cloud-Only Security Boundary" /></p>

<h3 id="document-purpose-and-scope">Document purpose and scope</h3>

<p>The purpose of this System Security Plan (SSP) is to describe the security implementation of the CloudSystem, including the underlying Azure and Office 365 components that are leveraged in its deployment. This document is designed to comply with the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM) documentation requirements for system authorisation.</p>

<p>This document is deliberately written using descriptive and explanatory language to assist an Agency to understand how the CloudSystem operates securely, the security controls it provides, and the residual controls that must be addressed by an Agency.</p>

<p>For detailed information on how the CloudSystem addresses specific controls in the ISM (June 2022 update), refer to the ‘DTA - Cloud-Only Blueprint - System Security Plan Annex (June 2022)’.</p>

<h3 id="overarching-security-policies">Overarching security policies</h3>

<p>The security policies that the CloudSystem has been designed to comply with are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Australian Government ISM (June 2022) controls.</li>
  <li>The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, including the Essential Eight Maturity Model.</li>
  <li>The ACSC Security Configuration Guide - Apple iOS 14 Devices (October 2021).</li>
  <li>The Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF).</li>
  <li>Hardening Microsoft Windows 10 version 21H1 Workstation (October 2021).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="related-security-documentation">Related security documentation</h3>

<p>In accordance with the requirements of the ISM, the following security documentation has been developed for the CloudSystem:</p>

<h3 id="risk-assessment">Risk assessment</h3>

<p>The results of the threat and risk assessment undertaken on the CloudSystem are documented in the ‘DTA – Cloud-Only Blueprint – Security Risk Management Plan’ (SRMP). This document describes the reduction in risk to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of system components and information processed and stored by the CloudSystem by the implementation of security controls and mitigations.</p>

<h2 id="assessment-of-services">Assessment of services</h2>

<p>This section provides details of the security assessment status of each Azure and Office 365 service used by the CloudSystem as listed in their respective IRAP reports. The assessment status of each of the utilised services and any associated mitigations is shown in Table 1.</p>

<h3 id="information-technology-and-cloud-services">Information technology and cloud services</h3>

<h4 id="applicability-to-cloudsystem-5">Applicability to CloudSystem</h4>

<p>Outsourcing is applicable to the CloudSystem as it leverages both Azure and Office 365, which are cloud services.</p>

<h4 id="cloudsystem-compliance-approach-5">CloudSystem compliance approach</h4>

<p>The CloudSystem leverages Microsoft Azure and Office 365, which have been IRAP assessed at PROTECTED by CyberCX. All CloudSystem services have been IRAP assessed.</p>

<p>Azure AD is defined as a non-regional service, but <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-data-storage-australia">hosts identity data in Australian datacentres</a> for customers that provide an Australian or New Zealand address. This includes Azure AD Directory Management and Authentication functions. Other Azure AD functions, including Azure MFA, store data in global datacentres.</p>

<p>Where possible the CloudSystem leverages services located in Australia, otherwise the United States is selected. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is available in the United Kingdom, Europe or United States regions. If the Azure AD tenant is in Australia, then the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/defender-cloud-apps/cas-compliance-trust">United States is automatically selected</a>. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/data-storage-privacy">Microsoft Defender for Endpoint</a> is available in Europe, United Kingdom, or in the United States. The United States is selected as part of the service creation for the CloudSystem.</p>

<h4 id="security-controls-provided-by-the-cloudsystem-5">Security controls provided by the CloudSystem</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Australian data locations have been selected where supported by Azure and Office 365 services leveraged by the CloudSystem. Where Australia is not available, the United States is used.</li>
  <li>Microsoft provides a shared responsibility model which outlines how security responsibilities are shared between itself and the Agency.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="residual-controls-to-be-addressed-by-the-agency-5">Residual controls to be addressed by the Agency</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The Agency must assess, establish, manage and maintain the commercial and contractual relationship with Microsoft as the provider of the cloud services and review changes to the Microsoft IRAP assessments as they occur.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="shared-responsibility">Shared responsibility</h4>

<p>When consuming a cloud service, management of some security controls is transferred from the Agency to the Cloud Service Provider (CSP), in this case Microsoft. The level of control transferred ultimately depends on the type of services being consumed i.e. cloud native or hybrid deployment and the agreement made with Microsoft.</p>

<p>Whilst responsibility for controls may be shared, Agencies must be conscious that security risk is not transferred to the service provider. It is therefore critical that Agencies understand how the sharing of responsibilities impacts system risk, and what impact it may have on <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/anatomy-cloud-assessment-and-authorisation">Assessing and Authorising the system within their environment</a>.</p>

<p>In general, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility">Microsoft defines</a> themselves as being responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensuring the physical systems and infrastructure required for the operation of a cloud service is secured appropriately.</li>
  <li>Being accountable in the event of an incident relating to the physical systems and infrastructure they manage as required for the operation of a cloud service.</li>
  <li>Assessing, managing and where possible mitigating risks inherent with the physical systems and infrastructure required for the operation of a cloud service.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the context of Software as a Service (SaaS) Protected Utility platforms, Microsoft is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incident response</li>
  <li>Backups</li>
  <li>Physical security</li>
  <li>System hardening</li>
  <li>Vulnerability and patch management</li>
  <li>Software development</li>
</ul>

<p>When deploying a cloud native model, in the context of SaaS Protected Utility platforms, the Agency is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access management</li>
  <li>System monitoring</li>
  <li>Client devices</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, the Agency is deemed accountable for any technology platform when in use, with Microsoft responsible for some or all of the platform operational management.</p>

<p>A suggested high-level shared responsibility matrix for the technology stack across the platform, Microsoft Office 365 and client devices has been tabled below. There are three defined stakeholders who share the responsibility to maintain the Agency’s security capabilities.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Agency</strong>: Australian government Agency adapting and implementing the DTA cloud native blueprint.</li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: Cloud Service Provider who provide and/or manage the defined technology platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Product Vendors</strong>: external product vendors (such as Apple for iOS) that provide or manage platforms within the Agency’s ecosystem that are not performed by Microsoft.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="applicability-to-cloudsystem-14">Applicability to CloudSystem</h4>

<p>This section is applicable as the CloudSystem includes mobile devices.</p>

<h4 id="cloudsystem-compliance-approach-14">CloudSystem compliance approach</h4>

<p>The CloudSystem leverages Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Intune (Intune) to provide both Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM) controls to protect mobile devices and data stored on them. Both Windows laptops and iOS devices will be enrolled within Intune and tagged as Corporate devices, allowing policies to be centrally managed and deployed. This includes configuring storage encryption, disabling unneeded features and controlling application behaviour.</p>

<p>The CloudSystem does not include the use of privately-owned mobile devices. Only Agency-owned devices are enrolled and allowed to access data.</p>

<p>iOS devices are hardened in accordance with the ACSC ‘<a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/security-configuration-guide-apple-ios-14-devices">Security Configuration Guide - Apple iOS 14 Devices</a>’ and Information Security Manual (ISM) with specific deviations to maximise usability for the target users as described below. Note: Agencies should do a risk assessment before deciding to change settings relating to mobile devices.</p>

<p>Bluetooth is enabled as it allows users to pair devices they may require to perform their duties (e.g. conference calls or online meetings).</p>

<p>Users can reset certain security settings in Personal Hotspot and Passcode for situations where the passcode/password may have been compromised.</p>

<p>The CloudSystem does not include the use of a full VPN on mobile devices, and therefore a direct connection to the internet is used. It is recommended Agencies consider implementing a VPN for mobile devices in accordance with the ACSC’s recommendation for iOS devices. The blueprint includes suggested <a href="https://desktop.gov.au/blueprint/abac/intune-configuration.html#ios-per-app-vpn">per app VPN configuration</a>, however the selection and configuration of a VPN server is the responsibility of the Agency.</p>

<p>Applications are installed from the App Store using the Volume Purchasing Program (VPP) tokens through Apple Business Manager Enrollment. This provides application control for iOS mobile devices, and removes the need for users having to install applications from the App Store through an Apple ID.</p>

<p>The risk of non-compliance with controls relating to iOS devices is addressed in the ‘<a href="security-risk-management-plan.html\">DTA - Cloud-Native Blueprint - Security Risk Management Plan</a>’ at <a href="security-risk-management-plan.html#r17-mobile-device-compromised">R17</a>.</p>

<h4 id="applicability-to-cloudsystem-22">Applicability to CloudSystem</h4>

<p>Operating system hardening is applicable to the CloudSystem.</p>

<h4 id="cloudsystem-compliance-approach-22">CloudSystem compliance approach</h4>

<p>The CloudSystem will utilise Windows 10 as the endpoint operating system, provided by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), and then use the Software Updates component of Microsoft Endpoint Manager to maintain the latest version of the operating system.</p>

<p>The CloudSystem will harden the operating system configuration using Intune policies to implement ACSC and vendor guidance. These Intune policies achieve the results that would traditionally be performed by Group Policy. Local administrator accounts and guest accounts will be disabled and renamed via Intune policy.</p>

<p>The potential attack surface will be minimised by only including required components and apps, removing and disabling the components that aren’t needed. Standard users will be prevented from running all script execution engines. The CloudSystem will install applications via Intune and not allow standard users the ability to install applications.</p>

<p>The CloudSystem will use Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) to perform application control. WDAC is the latest capability from Microsoft for application control and works in a very similar manner to AppLocker. In addition to the enforceable file types available from AppLocker, WDAC also supports driver files (.sys), and kernel mode policies as well as user mode enforcement.</p>

<p>Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) is not supported by the latest release of Windows 10 and all functionality of EMET has been incorporated into Windows Defender Exploit Guard which is fully configured.</p>

<p>PowerShell hardening and logging is configured via Intune for the Windows 10 SOE. As the blueprint does not include Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) the Protected Event Logging feature for PowerShell is not included.</p>

<p>Windows Defender Firewall is enabled as part of the CloudSystem Windows 10 Standard Operating Environment (SOE) and configured by Intune policies. Windows Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provide antivirus including signature, reputation and heuristic-based detection. Controlled folder access is also enabled to provide additional ransomware protection.</p>

<p>Scanning frequency for both quick scans and full scans is determined by the policies and occurs for fixed and removable drives.</p>

<p>Endpoint Device Control will be configured by Intune policies restricting usage to only permitted devices. This includes disabling Direct Memory Access (DMA).</p>

<h3 id="application-hardening">Application hardening</h3>

<h4 id="applicability-to-cloudsystem-23">Applicability to CloudSystem</h4>

<p>Application hardening is applicable to the CloudSystem.</p>

<h4 id="cloudsystem-compliance-approach-23">CloudSystem compliance approach</h4>

<p>The CloudSystem compliance approach is to select native cloud capabilities that are hardened and maintained as part of the service.</p>

<p>The CloudSystem utilises the Monthly Enterprise channel of Office to ensure the latest versions of software are used. Where third party applications are used these are also targeted at the most recent versions. Software update policies are configured to update plugins, browsers and applications regularly ensuring endpoints are using most recent versions.</p>

<p>ACSC guidance has been incorporated into the applications to harden the configuration and remove unneeded features, including the hardening guide for Office 365.</p>

<p>Web browsers are configured to block Flash content and Java content by the Intune policies. Neither Flash nor Java is included in the Windows 10 SOE. Native Microsoft Edge advertisement blocking is enabled. The blueprint recommends Agencies deploy a third-party add-on to provide further advertisement blocking.</p>

<p>Office macros sourced from the internet are blocked and only signed macros will be allowed to execute. Additional macro controls are configured in the Attack Surface Rules configuration controlled by Intune. Users are not able to change macro settings.</p>

<h4 id="security-controls-provided-by-the-cloudsystem-23">Security controls provided by the CloudSystem</h4>

<ul>
  <li>All applications are supplied by Microsoft which has made a commitment to secure development. The CloudSystem does not include any third-party applications.</li>
  <li>The latest version of Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Edge are installed. No third-party applications are installed.</li>
  <li>ACSC guidance has been implemented to harden Office and built-in web browsers.</li>
  <li>Unrequired functionality, such as Microsoft Access, has been removed.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="authentication-hardening">Authentication hardening</h3>

<h4 id="applicability-to-cloudsystem-24">Applicability to CloudSystem</h4>

<p>The authentication hardening section is applicable to the CloudSystem.</p>

<h4 id="cloudsystem-compliance-approach-24">CloudSystem compliance approach</h4>

<p>The CloudSystem leverages Azure AD for controlling system access. All technical capabilities that the CloudSystem performs are completed through Application and Service Principal objects in Azure AD, which utilise certificate-based authentication.</p>

<p>The CloudSystem utilises RBAC, automation and policy controls to restrict access to modify any of the functional capabilities provided by the CloudSystem. The CloudSystem also provides auditing and alerting on attempted or successful modifications of CloudSystem capabilities.</p>

<p>The CloudSystem provides security controls and an identity management framework that can be utilised to manage system access for systems deployed within the CloudSystem. The CloudSystem enforces multi-factor authentication through Conditional Access policies, creates recovery (emergency access) accounts for maintaining access to resources and enforces password policies for accounts created directly in Azure AD. The CloudSystem uses a soft-token - the Microsoft Authenticator app - to reduce the need for purchase, distribution and management of hard-tokens.</p>

<p>The Microsoft Authenticator app cannot be centrally managed to require the enforcement of a PIN or biometric unlock. It is also not currently considered verifier impersonation resistant.</p>

<p>The Protected User security group is not available in Azure AD and is therefore not used by the CloudSystem.</p>

<p>The CloudSystem utilises Azure AD to store groups utilised for RBAC and provides process and administration documentation for managing access to Azure resources.</p>

<p>To minimise potential user impact, Windows 10 laptops are not rebooted daily. Instead, automatic reboots are only performed as part of automated patching.</p>

<h4 id="security-controls-provided-by-the-cloudsystem-24">Security controls provided by the CloudSystem</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Azure AD is configured to require all users to be authenticated before granting access.</li>
  <li>Azure MFA is enforced for all standard and privileged users accessing M365 services.</li>
  <li>MFA requires Azure AD password and Microsoft Authenticator app (either acceptance of push notification or entry of OTP).</li>
  <li>Azure AD password complexity enforces a minimum character length of 8 characters.</li>
  <li>None of the authentication factors on their own can be used for single-factor authentication to another system.</li>
  <li>All authentication attempts are logged in Azure AD Sign-ins.</li>
  <li>Azure AD logs are forwarded to a Log Analytics workspace for long-term secure retention.</li>
  <li>Azure AD Smart Lockout is configured to lock account after five failed logon attempts.</li>
  <li>Legacy authentication methods are disabled in the Windows 10 SOE following the ACSC hardening guide.</li>
  <li>Credentials are stored within Azure AD.</li>
  <li>Standard Windows &amp; iOS functionality is to obscure passwords during logon.</li>
  <li>Windows Defender Credential Guard is enabled for the Windows 10 SOE. Remote Credential Guard is not applicable as the CloudSystem does not include servers.</li>
  <li>Only one previous logon is cached for the Windows 10 SOE.</li>
  <li>The CloudSystem Windows 10 SOE is configured with a screen saver after 15 minutes which requires users to re-authenticate.</li>
  <li>The CloudSystem Windows 10 SOE is configured with a logon banner provided by the Agency.</li>

<h4 id="applicability-to-cloudsystem-26">Applicability to CloudSystem</h4>

<p>The system administration section is applicable to the CloudSystem in the context of the operations and management of the controls that the CloudSystem provides.</p>

<h4 id="cloudsystem-compliance-approach-26">CloudSystem compliance approach</h4>

<p>Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs) and admin jump servers are not used in the CloudSystem due to the limited size of the expected Agencies and all administrative access to the Microsoft portals is with Azure AD accounts using MFA. The risk of not implementing these controls is addressed in the CloudSystem SRMP.</p>

<p>All administration of the CloudSystem is performed through a web browser to a number of Microsoft 365 portals as listed below:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

</table>

<p>The CloudSystem protects access to these portals through authentication via Azure AD and enforcement of MFA and location-based policies through Conditional Access. Privileges within the CloudSystem are controlled through the CloudSystem RBAC model.</p>

<p>The Conditional Access policies and RBAC model also extend to the administration of endpoint devices that are deployed as part of the CloudSystem.</p>

<h3 id="system-patching">System patching</h3>

<h4 id="applicability-to-cloudsystem-27">Applicability to CloudSystem</h4>

<p>System patching of Office 365 and Azure AD are not applicable as these cloud components are a Microsoft responsibility.</p>

<p>System patching of endpoint devices is required, and this is accomplished via Intune policies setting the frequency, installation options and reporting values.</p>

<h4 id="cloudsystem-compliance-approach-27">CloudSystem compliance approach</h4>

<p>The CloudSystem compliance approach is to primarily utilise native cloud capabilities that are patched as part of the service.</p>

<p>The CloudSystem uses Intune to automatically deploy operating system, application, driver, and firmware (where supported) updates to Windows 10 SOE devices. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provide a vulnerability management capability to aid Agencies in detecting missing patches and insecure configurations.</p>

<p>The blueprint does not include third-party applications or any unsupported software. The patching of other ICT equipment is not in scope of the CloudSystem.</p>

<h4 id="security-controls-provided-by-the-cloudsystem-27">Security controls provided by the CloudSystem</h4>

<h3 id="event-logging-and-auditing">Event logging and auditing</h3>

<h4 id="applicability-to-cloudsystem-30">Applicability to CloudSystem</h4>

<p>The controls relating to the logging and auditing of events for components included in the CloudSystem are applicable. The CloudSystem does not include web applications, databases, Domain Name System (DNS) or proxy services, and therefore the controls relating to these components are not applicable.</p>

<h4 id="cloudsystem-compliance-approach-30">CloudSystem compliance approach</h4>

<p>The CloudSystem provides extensive event logging and auditing for Azure and Microsoft 365 resources that can be incorporated into an Agency’s event logging strategy. Logs are stored in Log Analytics for two years which is the maximum available period for Log Analytics.</p>

<p>All logs relevant to the operation and integrity of the CloudSystem are stored in a centralised storage account. The CloudSystem protects the integrity of logs through policy enforcement, automation and RBAC.</p>

<p>Local event logs on Windows 10 devices will be lost when endpoints are rebuilt as the local event logs are not centralised.</p>

<p>The controls relating to cryptographic fundamentals are applicable to the CloudSystem.</p>

<h4 id="cloudsystem-compliance-approach-38">CloudSystem compliance approach</h4>

<p>The CloudSystem leverages cryptography provided by Microsoft to encrypt both data at rest and data in transit. This includes the use of Microsoft BitLocker to encrypt mobile devices using an Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) Approved Cryptographic Algorithm (AACA), namely AES. Note, that the CloudSystem does not use encryption for the purposes of reducing the handling requirements for endpoints.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s implementation of cryptography, including TLS 1.2 which is an ASD Approved Cryptographic Protocol (AACP), has been assessed as part of the IRAP assessments for Azure and Office 365. However, an ASD Cryptographic Evaluation (ACE) has not been performed on Microsoft’s cryptographic software.</p>

<p>At the time of writing Microsoft does not support the latest version of TLS – version 1.3. Microsoft have previously stated that versions 1.0 and 1.1 are not supported and were to become deprecated for Office 365 services from June 2020, however this has since been delayed due to world events. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/compliance/prepare-tls-1.2-in-office-365">Preparing for TLS 1.2 in Office 365 and Office 365 GCC</a>.</p>
