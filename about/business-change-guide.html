Adopting the blueprint is as much of a business transformation as it is a security and system process.</p>

<p>As we appreciate this is a complex process to undertake, we have created this business change guide. This guide will support you to understand how the Protected Utility blueprint can be implemented in your agency.</p>

<p>The guide contains suggestions, tools, templates, and guidance for successfully adopting the blueprint. It is intended for agencies to adapt as required to their business needs and modernisation journey.</p>

                                    <p>This is where you start your blueprint adoption experience. The Connect and Align phase is about setting you up with a clear understanding of the <a href="/blueprint/index.html">the blueprint</a> and how to align it to your business needs.</p>

<p>A large part of this phase is about being able to <a href="/assets/files/pdf/business-change-guide.pdf#page=8">self-identify your agency type</a>. We can also put you in touch with other agencies who have implemented technology based on the blueprint, which you can read about in our <a href="case-study.html">case study</a>.</p>

<p>In Connect and Align:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review the blueprint</li>
  <li>Self-identify your agency type</li>
  <li>Define initial needs, identify and enlist key stakeholders. Consider using our <a href="personas.html">personas</a> to understand potential needs and benefits.</li>
  <li>Read the <a href="case-study.html">case study</a> or connect with another agency who has undergone a prior implementation.</li>

                                    <p>In the Prepare and Design phase, it’s time to start planning your transition to the blueprint. To arm yourself with the right information to develop an effective plan, this phase will take you through the relevant assessments you’ll need to carry out to understand your starting point in terms of your business (systems and processes); your people (who will be impacted and how); and your technology. For example, you may like to assess your <a href="/assets/files/pdf/dta-technology-maturity-assessment-toolkit.pdf">technology maturity</a>.</p>

<p>In Prepare and Design:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Define mission and strategy (<a href="/assets/files/pdf/dta-strategy-analysis-toolkit.pdf">Toolkit</a>, <a href="/assets/files/xls/dta-strategy-analysis.xlsx">Template</a>)</li>
  <li>Assess your business needs or user stories. Consider your Procurement Plan and what resources you will need for the transition. Based on this, prepare your Statement of Work and Section 23.</li>
  <li>Consider the Operations Model, which can enable you to consider the roles and costs involved in supporting your blueprint implementation.</li>
  <li>Identify your risks (<a href="/assets/files/pdf/dta-risk-assessment-toolkit.pdf">Toolkit</a>, <a href="/assets/files/pdf/dta-risk-assessment.xlsx">Template</a>) or change impact (<a href="/assets/files/pdf/dta-change-impact-assessment-toolkit.pdf">Toolkit</a>, <a href="/assets/files/pdf/dta-change-impact-assessment.xlsx">Template</a>)</li>

                                    <p>This is where the rubber hits the road and we begin the blueprint implementation. The Deploy and Embed phase is designed to support you to adopt a Modern Workplace on the blueprint design, which is available to use in your agency’s ICT environment and plan for business change.</p>

<p>Often, a vendor (a technology partner or systems integrator) is required to assist the customer through the technology aspects of this process, while an organisational change management partner could assist you roll out and plan the change.</p>

<p>Additionally, you may like to use some of the (<a href="/assets/files//pdf/business-change-guide.pdf#page=14">communications material</a>) we have provided to develop messaging to sell the implementation to your various stakeholder groups.</p>

<p>In Deploy and Embed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up the relevant technical environment.</li>
  <li>Seek relevant architectural, change management, and security accreditation for the deployment.</li>
  <li>Implement blueprint technology.</li>
  <li>Configure appropriate application security controls in line with the blueprint and Information Security Manual (ISM).</li>
  <li>Undergo testing and provide assurance that the deployment has worked.</li>

<p>In Adopt and Engage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare and communicate strategic messages</li>
  <li>Adopt the business change and support staff with training</li>
